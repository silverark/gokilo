GoKilo
======

GoKilo is an attempt to port Antirez's [kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108) text 
editor to [Go Langugae](https://golang.org/). To build this, I have followed
this [tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html)
originally in C language that breaks down Kilo editor's development into a series
of small steps. 

Chapters [1 through 5](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) 
of the tutorial are complete and we have a fully functional basic text edtor. 
The next steps will be adding search and syntax highlighting functionality.

The codebase is currently very close to the original C code while I'm developing
it whihc means it may not be entirely in idiomatic Go style. I plan to refactor
the code once basic developmnt is complete and then potentially port the 
tutorial also.
